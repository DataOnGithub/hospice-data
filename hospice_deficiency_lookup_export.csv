579,"Deficiency cited: Prevention   
 
The hospice must follow accepted standards of practice to prevent the transmission 
of infections and communicable diseases, including the use of standard precautions. 
 
Accepted standards of practice for health care providers are typically developed by 
government agencies, professional organizations and associations.  Examples would 
include, but not be limited to, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the 
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, State Practice Acts, and commonly 
accepted health standards established by national organizations, boards, and councils 
(e.g., Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), 
American Nurses’ Association etc.)  
 
Standard Precautions are based on the principle that all blood, body fluids, secretions, 
excretions (except sweat), non-intact skin, and mucous membranes may contain 
transmissible infectious agents.  Standard Precautions include a group of infection 
prevention practices that apply to all patients, regardless of suspected or confirmed 
infection status, in any setting in which healthcare is delivered. These include: hand 
hygiene; use of gloves, gown, mask, eye protection, or face shield, depending on the 
anticipated exposure; and safe injection practices. Also, equipment or items in the patient 
environment likely to have been contaminated with infectious body fluids must be 
handled in a manner to prevent transmission of infectious agents (e.g., wearing gloves for 
direct contact, contain heavily soiled equipment, properly clean and disinfect or sterilize 
reusable equipment before use on another patient).  (Excerpt from CDC “Guideline for 
Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare 
Settings 2007.”)

A hospice may use contracted staff, if necessary, to supplement hospice 
employees in order to meet the needs of patients under extraordinary or other non-
routine circumstances. A hospice may also enter into a written arrangement with 
another Medicare certified hospice program for the provision of core services to 
supplement hospice employee/staff to meet the needs of patients. Circumstances 
under which a hospice may enter into a written arrangement for the provision of 
core services include: unanticipated periods of high patient loads, staffing shortages 
due to illness or other short-term temporary situations that interrupt patient care; 
and temporary travel of a patient outside of the hospice’s service area.  

Extraordinary circumstances generally would be a short-term temporary event that was 
unanticipated.  Examples of such circumstances might include, but are not limited to, 
unanticipated periods of high patient loads (such as an unexpectedly large number of 
patients requiring continuous care simultaneously), staffing shortages due to illness, 
receiving patients evacuated from a disaster such as a hurricane or a wildfire, or 
temporary travel of a patient outside the hospice’s service area. (589)

All staff designated by the hospice as having direct patient care responsibilities, including

Hospice plan of care. The hospice plan of care reflects the participation of the hospice, 
the SNF/NF or ICF/IID, and the patient and family to the extent possible.  (775)
 
The hospice and the facility must develop a coordinated plan of care for each patient that 
guides both providers.  When a hospice patient is a resident of a facility, that patient’s 
hospice plan of care must be established and maintained in consultation with 
representatives of the facility and the patient/family (to the extent possible).  The hospice 
portion of the plan of care governs the actions of the hospice and describes the services 
that are needed to care for the patient.  In addition, the coordinated plan of care must 
identify which provider (hospice or facility) is responsible for performing a specific 
service.  The coordinated plan of care may be divided into two portions, one of which is 
maintained by the facility and the other, which is maintained by the hospice.  The facility 
is required to update its plan of care in accordance with any Federal, State or local laws 
 and regulations governing the particular facility, just as hospices need to update their 
plans of care according to §418.56(d) of these CoPs.  The hospice plan of care must 
specifically identify/delineate the provider responsible for each 
function/service/intervention included in the plan of care. 
 
NOTE:  The providers must have a procedure that clearly outlines the chain of 
communication between the hospice and facility in the event a crisis or 
emergency develops, a change of condition occurs, and/or changes to the 
hospice portion of the plan of care are indicated.   (775)

approved by the hospice before implementation.  
 
The hospice and the facility must have a process in which they can exchange information 
from the hospice IDG plan of care reviews and assessment updates, and the facility team, 
patient and family (to the extent possible) conferences, when updating the plan of care 
and evaluating outcomes of care to assure that the patient receives the necessary care and

The intent of this regulation is for the hospice IDG to designate a member responsible for 
overseeing and coordinating the provision of care between the hospice and the facility.  
This person may or may not be the hospice RN responsible for the coordination of 
patient’s hospice care in the facility. It may also be the physician, social worker or 
counselor member of the IDG. In order to facilitate the coordination and provision of 
hospice care to the patient, the hospice and the facility should address how the hospice 
staff access and communicate with facility staff. This includes, but is not limited to: 

•  Development of each provider’s portion of the plan of care to assure that the plans 
are complimentary and reflect common goals and the patient’s expressed desire 
for hospice care; 
•  Documentation in both respective entities’ clinical records or other means to 
ensure continuity of communication and easy access to ongoing information; 
•  Role of any hospice vendor in delivering supplies or medications; 
•  Ordering, renewal, delivery and administration of medications; and 
•  Role of the attending physician, and process for obtaining and implementing
