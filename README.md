This repo contains processed data used for publication with [Hospice, Inc.](http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/hospice-inc/), published by The Huffington Post on June 19, 2014.


The original database was sent by [The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](http://cms.gov/) on April 1, 2014, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by The Huffington Post.

##Fields and Files

The `hospices_export.csv` file describes hospice providers where at least one full "certification" survey occurred between January 2, 2004 and March 21, 2014.  Fields are as follows:

1. Provider ID: The field used by CMS/CASPER applications to uniquely identify a provider (hospice, in this case)
2. Name: Name of the hospice
3. State
4. City
5. Address
6. ZIP Code
7. Ownership type - simple: A grouped categorization of the CMS provider owner type. Options are **nonprofit**, **for-profit**, **government**, **other**
8. Ownership type - detailed: The CMS/Casper field fully describing the owner type
9. Total surveys: The number of full government certification surveys. The Office of the Inspector General recommends that hospices be fully inspected and certified once every six years. CMS maintains three survey classifications: **standard/certification**, **complaint** and **federal monitoring surveys**. Only **certification** surveys are counted here.
10. Date of last certification survey: The date of the most recent **certification** survey. This field has been updated to reflect certification surveys conducted by private accreditation organizations. More [here](http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/hospice-inc/database#gotomethodology).
11. Date calculated: Date data was last updated.
12. Total deficiencies: Total deficiency (violation) count from all three types of surveys.
13. Complaint deficiencies: Total deficiencies from **complaint** surveys.
14. Certification deficiencies: Total deficiencies from **certification** surveys.
15. FMS deficiencies: Total deficiencies from **federal monitoring surveys**.

Because the data is nested, some fields must be looked up in additional files.

Deficiencies for each hospice are listed in the `hospice_deficiencies_export.csv` file. Use the **Provider ID** found in `hospices_export.csv` to lookup all deficiencies associated with a given hospice. This file describes a deficiency as:

1. Provider ID: A hospice’s provider id.
2. Date: Date of the survey 
3. Code: The deficiency code. For the complete details use this value to lookup a short and full descriptions listed in `hospice_deficiency_lookup_export.csv`
4. Survey type: The type of survey conducted when the deficiency was recorded. The three possible values **S** (standard/certification survey), **C** (complaint survey) and **F** (federal monitoring survey)

The `hospice_deficiency_lookup_export.csv` file lists the description of each hospice deficiency code. The original codes were described by CMS at this [url](http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/som107ap_m_hospice.pdf). Codes reserved for provider types other than hospice are not included and not described. The file’s fields are as follows:

1. Code: A unique identify for a deficiency
2. Edited description: The full descriptions found in [this](http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/som107ap_m_hospice.pdf) document were edited by The Huffington Post.
3. Short description: A brief description of the deficiency provided by CMS.

The `loc_export.json` file contains a dump of all the above files inside a single file.
